                    <h3>Let The Adventures Begin</h3>
                    <p>The Bozeman Montana area is rich in trails and the cycling community here is grateful for it. If shredding some trails is your thing then you can trek through Yellowstone National Park.  If you’re into going on a smooth ride on a vacation, then we have plenty of paved options for you as well.  The parks department here in Bozeman goes out of their way to ensure the outdoors can be enjoyed to the fullest. There are groomed trails waiting for you and puddles that want to get drained. You can find all of your riding adventures here.</p>
                    <p>Some of the best views you will ever see are only accessible by bike in the Sourdough Canyon along Bozeman Creek.  The Bangtail Divide is rated among the highest quality trail in the entire United States. The routes around Mystic Lake will leave you with something to write home about. The historical markers along the Moonshine Gulch Trail indicate locations early settlers of the Bozeman area took root and established homesteads. Bozeman provides the perfect weather for enjoying the ride from Spring throughout the Fall.</p>
                    <p>If you do not have a love for cycling outdoors and on challenging terrain give Bozeman a try and you soon will. Many of today’s best and most renowned riders began their adventures in mountain biking here.</p>

                    <h3>Keep it Safe</h3>
                    <p>So, you want to go mountain biking? Make sure you stay safe so that you can come back. We live for adventure, but we don't want the adventure to stop us from living. Safety is the primary concern when it comes to mountain biking. Mountain biking gives you access to remote areas and can take you to places you never imagined going and to see some spectacular views you have never seen before.  The problem is that if you have not seen it before then it must be at a location where not everyone goes. If you get hurt, there may not be assistance readily available. If you think safety first, then you will be able to enjoy the activity today and tomorrow. The number one rule in biking is to wear your helmet.  Number two is to make sure you are following rule number one.</p>
                    <p>Mountain biking can be dangerous.  That much is obvious, but the threats are what you have to think about. One of those threats is you. You need to know about yourself before you go where you should not.  You need to know when to stop and when you are entering an area that exceeds your skill level. Your skill level determines the trails you should ride and your ability to avoid unforeseen dangers along the ride.  Once you know your limits, take a look at the other riders around you.  Avoiding accidents with other riders is another primary concern. Be prepared for accidents, they are going to happen. Have a plan, if you know you would not be able to get up and walk after a crash in an area of a trail, then don't ride there. Walk that section if you need to go through it.</p>
                    <p>The next thing is to use a buddy system. Tell someone where you are going if no one is coming with you. Plan your route, if something happens you can be found be tracing your route.</p>
