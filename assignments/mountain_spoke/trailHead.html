                    <h3>Pink Ribbon Ride</h3>
                    <p>Every Monday night we host a “ladies only” charity ride. The ride is free of charge and will be led by one of our trail guides. Donations are accepted and appreciated.  The donations will help fund breast cancer awareness campaigns in the Bozeman area, and to aid those recovering from treatments involving breast cancer. Each rider will be given a pink ribbon to wear during the ride. This has become one of our most popular rides and has made a significant impact upon the lives of several Bozeman residents.</p>
                    <p>This ride is open to all levels of biking, ladies ages 16 and up.  It is a 15 to 25-mile ride depending on the group dynamic. The terrain of the ride will be decided on 15 minutes before the start and will depend on the group in attendance and skills levels of the riders. The popular option is the Bangtail Divide trail.</p>
                    <p>The ride will start at 5:30 PM and leave from the Mountain Spoke. It will last approximately 2 hours.</p>

                    <h3>The Mountain Spoke</h3>
                    <p>This ride is the namesake of our shop.  It is the most challenging ride we offer. When we opened our doors, we knew we had to be different than other bike shops out there.  We decided to follow our inspiration.  We first got the idea to serve the biking community when we biked to Curly Lake.  When we arrived at the lake we felt that the mountain was trying to tell us something and we listened to it. We can’t say that you will have the same experience on the ride, but we can say you will be challenged as you pedal through it.</p>
                    <p>The trailhead has an elevation of 5,800 feet and you will reach almost 10,000 feet at the peak.  Total Distance is 23 miles.  You must be an experienced biker to accept this challenge.  The cost is $85 per biker.  This ride includes transportation to and from the trailhead, a small lunch, dedicated trail guides, and a souvenir t-shirt. Please bring plenty of water as your hydration levels can become depleted very quickly on this ride.</p>
                    <p>This ride leaves from Mountain Spoke daily at 7:30 AM and will not return until 4:30 PM.
