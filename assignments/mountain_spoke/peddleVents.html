                    <h3>Meet The Reigning Grand Champion</h3>
                    <p>Just over 6 months ago John Griffon and his team became the latest winners of the event. John Griffon was able to sit down for an interview with our lead editor to share his experience Cycling the Continental Divide.</p>
                    <p class="question">How did this event change your career?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"This event changed my career long before I even signed up for the event.  Everyone in the cycling community has heard about this event.  It is like the US version of the Tour de France.  I got into cycling later than most.  My first competitive race was when I was 26 years old and it was sponsored by a local shop in Spring Valley, Utah. It was a 25-mile race and I finished in 10th place.  After that race I began looking at future possible races and the Continental Divide event peaked my interest.  I decided at that moment one day I would compete in the event. Every race I have done since has been in preparation for, and one step closer to the Continental Divide."</p>
                    <p class="question">And after the event?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"After the event my career has blown up.  I rode for so many years having only one sponsor, and now it seems like I am getting more offers every single day.  I used to have to save up for race entry costs and now I get contacted by race organizers asking if they can send me free entries.  I get recognized everywhere I go. I used to have to work to ride, and now I can ride for work."</p>
                    <p class="question">Is there any advice you would like to give to someone coming into a shop like Mountain Spoke picking out their first mountain bike?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"That bike you pick out today may not be the best bike in the world, but it will always have a special place in your heart.  The places you go on this bike will be some of the best places in the world.  You will be able to use that bike to learn about yourself and what you enjoy. The bike you get today can change your life, treat it right and it will take care of you."</p>
                    <p class="question">What was the biggest struggle you had to overcome for the race?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"The biggest struggle I had to overcome during my training was learning to lean on my team for support.  Throughout the beginning of my career I was a solo rider and did not have a support team to assist me along the way.  My first overnight endurance race I actually rode with a backpack which carried a pop-up tent and a pillow.  Now I have a team of 12 wonderful individuals and two chase cars to haul millions of dollars in specialized equipment along the course. Recognizing where I might fall short and where they are able to assist me takes a lot of pressure off and helps me to succeed.  Learning to delegate and give control over details to someone else was very hard for me to do.  Now I can concentrate on performing my best and just riding my bike."</p>
